Design Pattern: Singleton
Where used: /calendar/app/src/main/java/com/example/calendar/DataHolder.java
  DataHolder is a Singleton Class as it is used only 1 time to create an instance of the ArrayList of events

Location of test classes:
  /calendar/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/calendar/
  AddDeleteEvent.kt: Creates a new events, saves it to the list, and finally, deletes this event
  ChangeViewsTest.kt: Moves between the different views from weekly, to Three day, to daily, back to Monthly
  EventListTest.kt: Creates an event (checks if am radio button works), saves this event, then creates another event 
                    (checks if pm radio button works), saves this event. Next, goes back to home (Monthly view in this case)
                    and checks event list option
  MainActivityTest.kt: Checks multiple different functions on the Main page (Monthly view) such as the next month button and 
                       "More Options" drop down
  WeeklyTest.kt: Checks transition from Month view to week view through "More options"
  

Instruction to build and use software:
  All relavent files to build and run this calendar program are in the calendar folder.
  Open this folder in AndroidStudio and wait for AndroidStudio to build the project.
  Once AndroidStudio finishes building the project, hit the run button and the emulated android phone should open the calendar.
  The calendar will open in Month view.
  There is a drop down menu on the top right on every page that gives you options to change views.
  Choosing Weekly will take you to a week view.
  From here, the drop down has options to change view to Three day or Daily.
  Each page also has an event option in the drop down menu.
  Clicking this option will take you to the list of events.
  This page has a return to home option that take you back to the Month view.
  On Month view, there is also an "add events" button. Clicking on this will take you to a page that allows you to add events.
