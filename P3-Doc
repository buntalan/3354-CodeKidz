Instruction to build and use software:
  All relavent files to build and run this calendar program are in the calendar folder.
  Open this folder in AndroidStudio and wait for AndroidStudio to build the project.
  Once AndroidStudio finishes building the project, hit the run button and the emulated android phone should open the calendar.
  The calendar will open in Month view.
  There is a drop down menu on the top right on every page that gives you options to change views.
  Choosing Weekly will take you to a week view.
  From here, the drop down has options to change view to Three day or Daily.
  Each page also has an event option in the drop down menu.
  Clicking this option will take you to the list of events.
  This page has a return to home option that take you back to the Month view.
  On Month view, there is also an add events button. Pressing this will take you to a page that allows you to add events.
